BACKGROUND

Thereâ€™s no such thing as a lost cause with Lost Paws!
 
This app is to allow pet owners to post and share information about their pets that may have gotten lost. My parents gave me the idea after we all spent a night seeing all the lost pet alerts on the Neighborhood app get drowned out by a lot of other miscellaneous alerts. 

Lost Paws centralizes the sharing of information so that users can track down their pets and hopefully find others as well.

ACKNOWLEDGMENT

BIG thanks to my instructors and peers at NSS for helping me get to this point in my software development journey. Lost Paws is small but mighty, and it took a village to create it.
